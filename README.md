Nat's Pandemic JavaScript Arcade (2020)

https://natechols.github.io/pandemic-arcade/

All code is my original work and is in the public domain.  Most images are
from other sources, see separate license files for details.

These games are compact, minimalist examples of 2D animation using the HTML
Canvas API.  They are mostly functional and in some cases "feature-complete" but I
would not consider them "production code".  In particular I have not tried to optimize
the many O(N^2) loops because these are simple enough problems (and modern computers
are fast enough) to allow some corner cutting in the interest of rapid development.
You are free to recycle any code here for any purpose, public or private, but I do not
condone plagiarism on school assignments.
